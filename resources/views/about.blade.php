                <p>One of the most important items you own that affects the quality of your sleep is your pillow. A
                    quality pillow will cushion your head and neck with gentle support whilst being very adaptable to
                    the specific shape and weight of your head, neck and shoulders. This achieves a neutral spine and
                    relieves pressure throughout your entire body. Good sleeping posture means your body is in
                    alignment.</p>
                <p>Selecting a pillow is a very individual process and it is fundamental you find the pillow that works
                    for you. This depends on your size and your sleeping style.</p>
                <p>The correct firmness and loft of a pillow will give a comfortable, restful sleep keeping your head,
                    neck and spine aligned while sleeping. Your neck and shoulders must get sufficient support and not
                    be propped at an angle (up or down).</p>
                <p>Sleeping position also matters, your choice of firmness and loft should be based on your sleeping
                    style. For further guidance on your sleeping style please visit our Pillow Guide.</p>
                <p>Our Down & Feather products are professionally crafted by a wonderful team who draw on a wealth of
                    knowledge and experience creating a comprehensive, superior range of luxury pillows to enable you to
                    select your perfect item.</p>
